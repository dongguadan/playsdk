1. The dir dgdplaysdk and include is the sdk source cpp and headfile. You can use them on windows 7 and linux ubuntu.

2. The dir player and sdktest is the demo for windows while the sdktest2 is for linux.

3. The sdk use the other libs such as ffmpeg sdl d3d, so you should extract the 3party.

There are some problems such as i use different ffmpeg version and sdl costs too long to render a frame, welcome to 
provide suggestions and i will update later.
